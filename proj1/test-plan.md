# Project 1 Test Plan

## Use Case #1: Driver Registration and Dashboard Access

Test file:
- `proj1/tests/test_driver_registration_dashboard_pytest.py`

Runner:
- `proj1/tests/run_driver_registration_dashboard_pytest.sh`

Output location:
- `proj1/test-output/`

Setup:
1. Start the backend:
   `cd food-seer-backend`
   `mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Start the frontend:
   `cd food-seer-frontend`
   `npm start`
3. From the repository root, run:
   `proj1/tests/run_driver_registration_dashboard_pytest.sh`

Test Cases:
- Main success scenario: registers a new driver, logs in, verifies `ROLE_DRIVER`, and verifies driver statistics can be loaded.
- Extension 3a: sends incomplete registration information and verifies the system rejects it.
- Extension 5a: registers a second account with an existing email and expects a clean validation failure.
- Extension 7a: logs in with invalid credentials and verifies authentication is rejected.

Known Result:
- The main driver registration and dashboard access path passes.
- Extension 5a currently fails because the backend returns HTTP 500 from a database uniqueness error instead of a clean HTTP 400 validation response for duplicate email addresses.
